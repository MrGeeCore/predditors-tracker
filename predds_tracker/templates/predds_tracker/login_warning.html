<p>The structure of this web app has recently been modified significantly. In
order to allow both us and you to more effectively administer your alts, we now
require you to make the first login with your main account. This will not
require any scopes and is thus <strong>completely safe</strong>.</p>

<p>You can <strong>add your alts later</strong>; when you have logged in your
main, using the <em>'Add alt'</em> link at the top of the screen.</p>

<h2>Do <strong>not</strong> use this to log in your alts!</h2><br />

<a href="{% url 'social:begin' backend='eveonline' %}" class="btn btn-lg btn-danger" role="button" aria-pressed="true" style="font-size: 24px;">I have read the above and I
will <strong>only</strong> use this form to log in my <strong>main</strong></a>
